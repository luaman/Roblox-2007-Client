# Enabling Bloom and Depth of Field effects #

It was recently discovered that the shader code pertaining to the bloom/dof effects ([that were seen in some mid 2006 screenshots of the game](https://blog.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Aug20063.png)) are still present in this build, they are just disabled. You can enable them by using a hex editor on the game client exe. I personally use HxD.

Anyway, the offsets for these effects are listed below. You have to go to that offset and set its value from 00 to 01.
* Bloom: `102951` 
* Depth of Field: `10295E`

NOTE BY LUAMAN:
the offsets for Roblox `0.3.488.0` (the earliest build currently in the wild) are as follows:

* Bloom: `FE891`
* Depth of Field: `FE89E`
